I will be attempting to train a Tensorflow image classification model on a custom dataset I made. 

I combined images from the [UAVVaste](https://github.com/UAVVaste/UAVVaste) and [TACO](https://github.com/pedropro/TACO) datasets.

Code largely based on [Tensorflow Docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification)
